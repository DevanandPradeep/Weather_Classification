## Weather Classification

This project proposes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture using TensorFlow for weather classification.
The model categorizes images into five classes: rainy, cloudy, sunny, foggy, and sunrise.
When tested on 40 weather images, with 8 images from each class, the model achieved an accuracy of 85%.
