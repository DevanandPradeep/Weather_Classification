## Weather Classification

This project proposes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture using TensorFlow for weather classification.
The model categorizes images into five classes: rainy, cloudy, sunny, foggy, and sunrise.
When tested on 30 weather images, of 5 different class, the model achieved an accuracy of 85%.
